# PinGod - RolloverLanes demo
---

Demo for `PinballSwitchLanesNode` node.

Rollover Lanes are common in pinball games. Most games have lanes at the top which add to a bonus multiplier and also lanes around the flipper area (In and Out / Return Lanes).

Lane Lamps are usually changed with the flipper buttons.

# PinGod Home

## What is it?
---

PinGod is for creating pinball game logic with graphics display window.

A pinball machine or a simulator can trigger the game and vice versa.

## Why that name?
---

The Godot game engine was used so it's `Pinball + Godot = PinGod`.

#### `PinGo` or `PinGodot`?  

We know who the penguin is and PinGodot doesn't ring well. This isn't a holy framework but you can makes games faster like a `Pin God` so we can rest the case on that decision.

## Is it difficult to learn and use?
---

Not really, it's far more difficult to write this documentation...

Godot doesn't have a steep learning curve and you don't need to know everything to be able to finish a game or make scenes.

There are full examples in the `src` with `basic to advanced` scripted games which will give you an idea of sripting tasks and how things were done.

## Advantages?
---

- Framework base that covers standard pinball machine features used across games
- C# scripting (or GScript)
- Easy to make 2D, 3D graphics scenes
- Collaborating with others on Scenes / Scripts
- Localization
- Recording/Playback of games saves much time in testing

More to be added when comes to mind..

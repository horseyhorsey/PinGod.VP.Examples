This plugin addon is for adding some custom controls for the Godot UI. `BlinkingLabel` is one example.

#### Build

The `MainScene` should be visible and you can build the project (top right button).

If build success, you can re-enable the plugin if you need to, but it isn't needed to run the game for now.

#### Play

Hit `F5` to run the game. You can use `F2` on the window to show border.

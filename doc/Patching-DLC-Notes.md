# Game Updates / Patches / DLC / Mods
---

Deliver the project to players then when one wants to add functionality or content later on, just deliver the updates via PCK files to the players.

Instead of shipping whole game over again. .Pcks can be made and imported by the game later on.

Resources like scenes, scripts etc can be exported into pack from the export menu and on the resources tab.

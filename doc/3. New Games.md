# 3. New Games
---

## Duplicating from the BasicGame example
---

- Make a copy of the `BasicGame` directory and rename it to your game name `MyNewGame`
- Inside this folder rename the `Godot` project and `VP` directory to similar. `MyNewGameGodot` and `MyNewGameVisualPinball`.

## Godot project setup
---

- In `MyNewGameGodot` rename the 3 project files from `BasicGameGodot` to `MyNewGameGodot`.
- Using `VsCode` or similar to replace text in files rename `BasicGameGodot` to `MyNewGameGodot`

## Visual pinball setup
---

- Rename the table file to something like `MyNewGame (PinGod) VPX10-6.vpx`
- Open the tables script window in `Visual Pinball` and set the game directory to your `MyNewGameGodot` game path.

Provided you have the controller setup the table should run and build godot project and launch.

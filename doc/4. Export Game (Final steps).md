# 4. Export Game (Final steps)
---

This would be the final step but isn't necessary when creating / debugging games.

## Export on Command line
---

Run the export preset already setup with this project. Game is exported to `../Export/PinGod.BasicGame.exe`

`godot --export "Windows Desktop"`

This game exe can be run from VP script Controller with the `.Run` method instead of `.RunDebug`

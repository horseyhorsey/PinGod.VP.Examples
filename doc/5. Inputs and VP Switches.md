# 5. Inputs and VP Switches
---

## Adding a new switch
---

### Godot Input Action
---

Add `sw27` into the mapping in `Project Settings > Input Map`. You don't need to specify a key unless you're wanting to send the switch to the window.

`Game.cs` - This example game class is handling the other inputs (The In and Out flipper lanes). Add the following to that class..

```
if (@event.IsActionPressed("sw27")) // my new switch
{
	Print("sw: my new switch");
	AddPoints(50);
	//Do stuff
}
```

*You could add another for input release (state 0) `IsActionReleased("sw27")`*

### Visual pinball
---

- Add a `Spinner` to the table. If we add this `Spinner` to the top of plunger lane we can get instant feedback when we launch the ball.
- In the `Spinners` properties add the number `27` to the `TimerInterval`
- Add the `Spinner` to the `AllSwitches` collection by right clicking and `Add/Assign to collection` 


## Testing
---

You can test that you can get scores updated if you assigned `sw27` to a key by running the `Game` scene on its own.

Test in Visual Pinball making sure you got those points when you pass through the spinner.

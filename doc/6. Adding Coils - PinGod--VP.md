# 6. Adding Coils - PinGod--VP

## Adding to Machine Class

[Machine.cs](../src/BasicGame/BasicGameGodot/global/Machine.cs)

Instead of having a pile of files extra to configure, the `Coils, Switches, Lamps` are in the `Machine` class.

Use the `PinGodGame` methods `AddCustomSolenoids`. Check the already added coils below.

You can find some custom added as an example `Machine.Coils.Add("lampshow_2",		35);`.

[PinGodGame.AddCustomSolenoids](../src/BasicGame/BasicGameGodot/global/PinGodGame.cs)

## Using coil / solenoids

`SolenoidPulse("auto_plunger")` Pulse the auto plunger

`SolenoidOn("flippers", 1)` ' enable the flippers

These are just wrappers for the OScService which can be used instead. 

Having the names like this in code is a lot quicker than dealing with digits only.


## Visual Pinball

The script to handle `35` would be `SolCallback(35) = "Lampshow2"`. This will invoke the `LampShow2` sub routine.

- SolCallback(0) = "Died"  ' If at some point Godot closes then this lets VP know about it
- SolCallback(1) = "bsTrough.solOut" ' The trough which makes the ball pop out....
- SolCallback(2) = "FlippersEnabled" ' Enable and disable flippers, when ball drains, tilt etc


## Default Collections (Machine)

```
    public static readonly Coils Coils = new Coils()
    {
        {"died",            0},
        {"trough",          1},
        {"flippers",        2},
        {"auto_plunger",    3},
        {"mball_saucer",    4},        
    };
```

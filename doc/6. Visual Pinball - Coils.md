# 6. Visual Pinball - Coils

## SolCallbacks

When Visual Pinball detects changed coils the callbacks are invoked by coil number.

The script to handle `35` would be `SolCallback(35) = "Lampshow2"`. This will invoke the `LampShow2` sub routine.

```
SolCallback(0) = "Died"  ' If at some point Godot closes then this lets VP know about it
SolCallback(1) = "bsTrough.solOut" ' The trough which makes the ball pop out....
SolCallback(2) = "FlippersEnabled" ' Enable and disable flippers, when ball drains, tilt etc
```

## VPM Core.vbs objects

Flippers enabled has its own sub routine but `bsTrough.solOut` is done automatically.

Inside the `InitGame` routine the `bsTrough` is initialized with our switches.

When it hits the `Drain` kicker a ball will be added and taken care of and when we fire the coil `BallRelease` will eject ball into plunger lane.

```

Set bsTrough = New cvpmTrough
bsTrough.Size = 4
bsTrough.Balls = 4
bsTrough.InitSwitches Array(81,82,83,84) ' trough switches
bsTrough.InitExit BallRelease, 90, 8	
bsTrough.CreateEvents "bsTrough",  Drain
bsTrough.InitEntrySounds "Drain", "", ""
bsTrough.InitExitSounds "BallRelease", ""
bsTrough.Reset
